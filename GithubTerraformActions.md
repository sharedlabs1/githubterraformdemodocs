# Integrating GitHub Flow with Terraform
#
Here are the steps to integrate GitHub Flow with your Terraform workflow:

1. **Set up a GitHub repository**
   - Create a new repository on GitHub for your Terraform code.
   - Initialize it with a README and a `.gitignore` file for Terraform.

2. **Structure your Terraform project**
   - Organize your Terraform files in a logical structure (e.g., modules, environments).
   - Create a `main.tf` file for your primary configuration.
   - Add `variables.tf` and `outputs.tf` files as needed.

3. **Set up branch protection rules**
   - In your GitHub repository settings, create branch protection rules for your main branch.
   - Require pull request reviews before merging.
   - Optionally, require status checks to pass before merging.

4. **Implement GitHub Flow**
   - For each new feature or change:
     a. Create a new branch from the main branch.
     b. Make changes to your Terraform code in this branch.
     c. Commit changes regularly with descriptive commit messages.

5. **Use Terraform workspaces**
   - Create workspaces for different environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod).
   - Use workspace-specific variable files (e.g., `dev.tfvars`, `prod.tfvars`).

6. **Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions**
   - Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository.
   - Add a YAML file (e.g., `terraform.yml`) for your GitHub Actions workflow.
   - Configure the workflow to run on pull requests and pushes to main.

7. **Define GitHub Actions workflow**
   - Install Terraform
   - Initialize Terraform
   - Validate Terraform configurations
   - Plan Terraform changes
   - Apply Terraform changes (only on merge to main)

8. **Implement pull requests**
   - When your feature branch is ready, create a pull request to merge into main.
   - Include a description of the changes and any relevant information.

9. **Review and merge**
   - Team members review the pull request, checking the Terraform plan.
   - After approval and passing checks, merge the pull request.

10. **Automate Terraform apply**
    - Configure your GitHub Actions workflow to automatically apply changes when a pull request is merged to main.
    - Use Terraform workspaces to manage different environments.

11. **Monitor and iterate**
    - Monitor your infrastructure for any issues after changes are applied.
    - Continuously improve your Terraform configurations and workflow.

Example GitHub Actions workflow (`terraform.yml`):

```yaml
name: 'Terraform CI/CD'

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  terraform:
    name: 'Terraform'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Setup Terraform
      uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v1

    - name: Terraform Init
      run: terraform init

    - name: Terraform Format
      run: terraform fmt -check

    - name: Terraform Plan
      run: terraform plan

    - name: Terraform Apply
      if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && github.event_name == 'push'
      run: terraform apply -auto-approve
```

Remember to adjust this workflow based on your specific needs, such as adding environment-specific variables or incorporating secret management.
